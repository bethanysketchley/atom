    <p> My name is Bethany and I am 34 years old. I am a single mom who is looking for a career change, and that is where coding comes in. 
        My coding journey began back in January and my goal is to become a full stack developer. 
        When I am not working on coding I enjoy spending time with my daughter who will be 10 in May, family and friends.</p>

    <h2 id="my-start">How I got my start</h2>  
    <p>This past January I enrolled in a JavaScript prep course, where for four weeks, we were introduced to the fundamentals of JavaScript. Learning how to code is different than anything I have ever done before, and to say that I struggled with it and became discouraged would be an understatement. But honestly struggling through the course, and then continuing learning on my own has been so beneficial to me and has helped my confidence grow. I've learned that asking for help and not knowing all the answers is okay. Learning this has helped me become more confident, and I am excited to continue on this journey.</p> 
    <p>Finding Grand Circus bootcamp was sort of like findnig a needle in a hay stack for me. After my coding prep course ended in January I looked at a bunch of other coding bootcamps but none really seemed to offer a full stack bootcamp that was in the price point or cirriculum that I was looking for. Right from day one before the bootcamp actually begins, Grand Circus provides you with tons of research and practice project opportunities to help you in your coding jouney. I love that I am able to delve right into the content and get a jump start learning different coding languages. Becoming a full stack developer requires a lot of time and effort. But having all the resources that Grand Circus provides you is invaluable, and I feel like I am ready for anything.</p>
